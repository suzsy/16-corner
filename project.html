        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner is a portfolio of 5 multifamily properties totaling 44 units built between 1949 and 1952. Tenants of these units had been living in Overtown for generations. The five properties were identified as unsafe structures by the City of Miami in 2018. The city was facing a decision of whether to demolish this project or to preserve it. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were demolished, tenants would face displacement losing both their home and long-term community. Besides, the land was zoned for T3-O, under Miami 21 master plan, it can only allow 18 units per acres. The whole land was a little more than half an acre, which means the maximum density allowed would be 12 units that significantly lowered the building stock in this neighborhood that has already facing housing shortage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avra Jain, the founder of The Vagabond Group was approached by Omni CRA to take on this project preserving the distinct architectural features of the original buildings, retrofitting the building structure, and restoring homes for the residents.   </p>

        <h2>Public-Private Partnership</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner was a collaborative effort between The Vagabond Group (“Vagabond”), Omni CRA (“CRA”), and Mt.Zion Community Development Corporation (“Zion”). CRA granted $3.8 million forgivable loan ($1.8 million for property acquisition and $2 million for construction) to Vagabond with an agreement of a 30-year Affordable Housing Covenant on all units buying out rent for the next 30 years. Zion served as local partner that granted them 7.5% ownership interest in the partnership within the 30-year cycle. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project set an example for community-driven projects utilizing public funding in addition to private funding while serving the community with local organization that represent the best interest of the local people.</p>
        
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/Base Map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project is in the northern part of Overtown that falls into Omni CRA district. The project consists of three parcels that borders the Overtown CRA along the north-south axis of Northwest 1st Place connecting to one of the more challenging areas in Omni CRA district. </p>

        <h2>Scale</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/aerial map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole project consists of five 2-story garden-style apartment buildings covering 29,400 sf in land and 20,312 sf inbuilding. There're in total of 44 units with 12 units studio, 20 units 1 bedroom, 6 units 2 bedrooms and 6 units 3 bedrooms apartments. The renovation started in late 2018 and will be completed in 2025.</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 corner was the first project that was issued Tax Increment Finance (TIF) by Omni CRA for creating more affordable housing within the Omni CRA district and it was also the first affordable housing project Omni CRA ever funded at that time. </p> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project is in historic Overtown, an underserved community, that had experienced displacement in the past and now it is under the pressure of further gentrification and facing a significant housing shortage and homelessness problems. Most of the buildings were built decades earlier and needed renovation and major improvements. The Vagabond Group helped preserving the historical building structures, upgrading the building system along with the interior finishes in each unit to modern standards and sustaining the sense of the community for legacy tenants in Overtown. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there were no displacement of tenants during the renovation process. The renovation was constructed one building at a time. When one building was under renovation, tenants were moved to vacant units in other buildings within the project. There was no rent increase during the first 5 years and currently, all legacy tenants remain their rent level at or below 60% AMI rent. Moreover, they were offered to move back to their original units after the renovation. The quality of life of tenants were significantly improved after moving into their new units. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, Vagabond has recruited local construction team and contractors creating jobs for local small businesses. Currently, one of the onsite property managers is one of the legacy tenants of 16 corner.</p>
        
        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vagabond Group has conducted community outreach and engagement to ensure the project align with the needs of the residents. </p>  
        <img src="Project summary/kitchen.jpg" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design with thoughtfulness: Considering tenants’ needs for extra storage, we custom built floor-to-ceiling cabinets creating more space for storage for tenants. We’ve also added walk-in closets with mirror added in each bedroom. Additional features such as deep sink, faucet with extension and full backsplash making it easy for tenants to retain tidiness in kitchen. What’s more, we’ve noticed tenants’ tendency to save electrical bills in the summer, besides traditional AC, we’ve also added ceiling fans in each unit. We deeply care about the wellbeing for tenants. All the windows are altered to larger sizes bringing more natural lights into the units and blinds are installed for all windows. Moreover, larger and heavier doors are installed for each unit providing extra security and protection for tenants. Lastly, the laundry room in the project was long abandoned, we’re going to restore it back to better serve our tenants. </p>
        <img src="Project summary/window.jpg" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built for longevity: Older buildings tend to have weak soundproofing system; we’ve assessed sound attenuation adding resilient channel and extra soundproof in walls. Additionally, considering the humid climate in Miami that easily cause mold growth, we’ve used mold resistant materials to extend the longevity of the building. Lastly, all windows are switched to screened windows allowing extra air circulation if needed.</p>

        <img src="Project summary/sustainability.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainability: Track lightings were installed in the kitchen which help reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. We’ve also self-funded additional landscape and exterior features. Notably, we brought three beautiful palm trees to the courtyard between building 1540 and 1550 creating an oasis for tenants.   </p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety: Hallways are usually where crimes happen in challenging neighborhood. We’re planning to work with the city to close the hallway between parcel 1 and parcel 3 ensuring safety for our tenants. </p>
