    <div class="project-section">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner is a portfolio of five multifamily properties comprising 44 units, originally built between 1949 and 1952. Many residents have longstanding ties to Overtown, with some families living in the area for generations. In 2018, the City of Miami designated the five buildings as unsafe structures, prompting a critical decision: whether to demolish the properties or pursue preservation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Demolition would have significantly disrupted the community, displaced residents and reduced local housing options. The site—zoned T3-O under the Miami 21 Master Plan—permits only 18 units per acre. With the entire site spanning just over half an acre, only 12 units would be allowed under current zoning, further diminishing the housing stock in a neighborhood already facing a shortage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avra Jain, founder of The Vagabond Group, was approached by the Omni Community Redevelopment Agency (CRA) to lead the preservation of the existing structures. The goal was to retain the original architectural features, preserve housing supply, retrofit the buildings for safety and resilience, and restore healthy housing for current and future residents. </p>

        <h2>Public-Private Partnership</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner was realized through a collaboration between The Vagabond Group (“Vagabond”), the Omni CRA (“CRA”), Mt. Zion Community Development Corporation (“Zion”), and Miami Dade Public Housing and Community Development (“PHCD”) additional funding. The CRA provided a $3.8 million forgivable loan—$1.8 million for acquisition and $2 million for construction—with a 30-year Affordable Housing Covenant placed on all units, ensuring long-term affordability. The PHCD provided additional funding to cover shortfalls through the Surtax Loan Program and the Development Inflation Adjustment Fund (“DIAF”).  </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Zion joined as a community-based partner, receiving a 7.5% ownership interest in the project. Their role was to help with community outreach and to connect local residents with any vacancy opportunities. The partnership exemplifies a community-driven model that leverages both public and private investment to support equitable development and strengthen local engagement. </p>
        
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/16 Corner Location Map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is in Overtown within the Omni CRA district. It spans three parcels along the north-south corridor of Northwest 1st Place, adjacent to one of the more underserved areas in the district.</p>

        <h2>Scale</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/aerial map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The development comprises five two-story, garden-style apartment buildings, covering a total land area of 29,400 square feet and with a total a building footprint of 20,312 square feet. It includes 44 units: 12 studios, 20 one-bedrooms, 6 two-bedrooms, and 6 three-bedrooms. Renovation began in late 2018 and is scheduled for completion in 2025.</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner was the first affordable housing project funded by the Omni CRA, fulfilling a mandate to help local residents. Located in historic Overtown—a community that has experienced significant disruption from major infrastructure development—the project addresses the ongoing shortage of quality housing while preserving neighborhood character. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the original buildings required extensive upgrades. Vagabond oversaw the restoration of architectural features and the renovation of both interiors and exteriors, while also prioritizing local economic impact by engaging local contractors and small businesses. Renovations were completed one building at a time to avoid displacing residents. Tenants were temporarily relocated to vacant units within the complex with the opportunity to return to their original home upon completion. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No rent increases were implemented during the first five years of renovation, and legacy tenants currently pay rents at or below 60% of Area Median Income (AMI)—some as low as $525 for a studio, $656.25 for a 1-bedroom, $ 813.75 for a 2-bedroom, and $892.50 for a 3-bedroom. The upgraded units have significantly improved residents’ quality of life. One of the original residents now serves as the onsite property manager.</p>
        
        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <h3>Thoughtful Design</h3>
        <img src="Project summary/kitchen.jpg" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovations were tailored to meet residents’ needs. Kitchens now feature custom-built, floor-to-ceiling cabinets for added storage, deep sinks, and tiled backsplashes. Each bedroom includes built-out closets with mirrored doors. An on-site laundry room—previously abandoned—will be fully restored by the end of construction. </p>  
        <img src="Project summary/window.jpg" class="project-image">
        
        <h3>Built for Longevity</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To enhance durability, comfort, and soundproofing, upgrades include resilient channels, whisper mats beneath flooring, and additional mold-resist wool insulation between walls and in ceilings.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ceiling fans were installed in addition to energy efficient air conditioning systems to provide flexible climate control. All impact glass windows were replaced with screened models to allow for natural ventilation when desired.</p>
        <img src="Project summary/sustainability.png" class="project-image">
        
        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kitchens feature track lighting to reduce energy consumption and improve overall functionality. Additionally, four palm trees now stand in the courtyard between buildings 1540 and 1550, creating welcoming shade and green space for residents. Additional landscaping enhancements are planned for the remaining buildings as the project progresses.</p>

        <h2>Challenge </h2>
        <h3>1.Funding challenge</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 Corner was financed through a combination of public and private sources. Initially, it received a $3.8 million forgivable loan from Omni CRA, a $1.76 million loan from a local bank, and $400,000 in equity. Additional funding included $812,000 from the Surtax Loan Program in 2022 and $585,000 from Development Inflation Adjustment Fund (DIAF) in 2023 issued by Miami Dade County Public Housing and Community Development (PHCD).</p>
        <img src="Project summary/16 Corner Funding Summary.png" class="project-image">
        <p>(Developer: Avra Jain additional investment)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The total projected cost of the project is approximately $9.2 million, averaging $177,000 per unit. Beyond traditional loans, equity, and grants, The Vagabond Group contributed by waiving the developer fee and covering architectural project management costs, totaling an in-kind contribution of $1 million. (See funding structure graph below for details.)</p>
        <img src="Project summary/16 Corner Funding Structure.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accessing public funding, even for experienced developers, can involve months of applications and extensive documentation. For newer developers, this process can be especially daunting, making projects like this financially feasible remains a common challenge across the industry.</p>

        <h3>2.Carrying Costs and Budget Shortfalls</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Building 1535 serves as an example of unexpected cost fluctuations in a prolonged phased development. This building experienced the most disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Supply chain shortages led to sharp increases in construction material costs. Although the original estimate for construction was $644,000, final costs rose to nearly $1 million. </p>
        <img src="Project summary/1535 & 1540 payapp sum.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five highest-cost categories for Building 1535 were drywall, electrical, plumbing, structural work, and windows. Plumbing costs nearly doubled, and window costs increased by more than 50% compared to the original contract. Building 1540 was the first to be completed, and the same five categories cost $156,198.45 less than in 1535 (see details below). This represents a 74% increase in costs for 1535 compared to 1540.</p>
        <img src="Project summary/1535 & 1540 comparison.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budget shortfalls and additional carrying costs were ultimately borne by the developers. For developers with limited access to alternative funding, such overruns can jeopardize project progress.</p>   
        
        <h3>3.Municipal Coordination</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A portion of 16 Corner’s funding came from the PHCD’s Surtax Loan Program. However, each disbursement request (draw) required a lengthy review and approval process, often taking several months. This delay created added financial and administrative burdens, particularly for smaller development firms with limited staffing and funds. </p>

        <h3>4.Misconception about Renovation</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a common perception that renovation is more cost-effective than new construction. However, 16 Corner demonstrated that this is not always the case. The buildings had not undergone major improvements since their original construction in the 1950’s. Once renovation began, severe deterioration was discovered: compromised foundations, structural instability, and widespread mold in old building materials. In effect, the project became a near-total rebuild. Were it not for zoning restrictions that would have reduced allowable density, ground-up new construction approach would likely have been more cost-efficient and timesaving.</p>

        <h3>5.The Cost of Doing Things Right. </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Renovation on Building 1535 was paused for nearly two years during the pandemic due to a commitment to responsible construction practices and the logistical challenges of relocating residents during the process. </p>

        <h3>6.Security Challenges</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Construction sites must always guard against theft of materials – however, absorbing that expense is much more difficult for a small project. Several theft incidents occurred during construction. Plumbing and electrical infrastructure comprised of copper and aluminum were stolen on multiple occasions. Additionally, workers’ tools and appliances were taken. To avoid further unexpected costs and delays in replacing materials, the Omni CRA was able to provide a security company at their expense. </p>
