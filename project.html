        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner is a portfolio of 5 multifamily properties totalling 44 units built between 1949 and 1952. Tenants of these units had been living in Overtown for generations. The five properties were identified as unsafe structures by the City of Miami in 2018. The City was facing a decision of whether to demolish this project or find ways to preserve it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were demolished, tenants would face displacement losing both their home and long term community. Besides, the land was zoned for T3-O, under Miami 21 master plan, it can only allow 18 units per acres. The whole land was a little more than half an acre, which means the maximum density allowed would be 12 units which would significantly lower the building stock in this neighborhood that has already facing housing shortage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avra Jain, the founder of The Vagabond Group was approached by Michael Liu, who was leading the PHCD in City of Miami, to take on this project preserving the distinct architectural features of the original buildings and restoring homes for Overtown residents. </p><!-- Your content here -->

        <h2>Public-Private Partnership</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner was a collabrative effort between The Vagabond Group, Omni CRA, and Mt.Zion Community Development Corporation.</p>

        <h2>Scale</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole project consists of five 2-story garden-style apartment buildings covering 29,400 sf in land and 20,312 sf inbuilding. The three adjacent parcels border the Overtown CRA along the north-south axis of NW 1st Pl and provide a critical node to one of the more challenging areas bounding the Omni CRA district. There're in total of 44 units with 12 units studio, 20 units 1 bedroom, 6 units 2 bedrooms and 6 units 3 bedrooms apartments. The renovation started in late 2018 and will be completed in 2025.</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 corner was the first project that was issued Tax Increment Finance (TIF) by Omni CRA for creating more affordable housing within the Omni CRA district and it is also the first affordable housing project Omni CRA ever funded. The project is located in historic Overtown which is an underserved community that had experienced displacement in the past and now it is under the pressure of further gentrification and facing a significant housing shortage and homelesness problems. The majority of the buildings were built decades earlier and were in need of renovation and major improvements. The Vagabond Group helped preserving the historical building structures, upgrading the building system along with the interior finishes in each unit to modern standards and sustaining the sense of the community for legacy tenants in this project and in Overtown in general. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there were no displacement of tenants during the renovation process. The renovation was conducted one building at a time. When one building was under renovation, the tenants were moved to vacant units in other buildings within the project. There were no rent increase during the first 5 years and currently, all legacy tenants still remain their rent level at or below 60% AMI rent and they were offered to move back to their original units after the renovation. The quality of life of tenants were significantly improved after moving into their new units </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vagabond Group has conducted community outreach and engagement to ensure the project is responsive to
