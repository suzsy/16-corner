        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner is a portfolio of 5 multifamily properties totaling 44 units built between 1949 and 1952. Tenants of these units had been living in Overtown for generations. The five properties were identified as unsafe structures by the City of Miami in 2018. The city was facing a decision of whether to demolish this project or to preserve it. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it were demolished, tenants would face displacement losing both their home and long-term community. Besides, the land was zoned for T3-O, under Miami 21 master plan, it can only allow 18 units per acres. The whole land was a little more than half an acre, which means the maximum density allowed would be 12 units that significantly lowered the building stock in this neighborhood that has already facing housing shortage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Avra Jain, the founder of The Vagabond Group was approached by Omni CRA to take on this project preserving the distinct architectural features of the original buildings, retrofitting the building structure, and restoring homes for the residents.   </p>

        <h2>Public-Private Partnership</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 Corner was a collaborative effort between The Vagabond Group (“Vagabond”), Omni CRA (“CRA”), and Mt.Zion Community Development Corporation (“Zion”). CRA granted $3.8 million forgivable loan ($1.8 million for property acquisition and $2 million for construction) to Vagabond with an agreement of a 30-year Affordable Housing Covenant on all units buying out rent for the next 30 years. Zion served as local partner that granted them 7.5% ownership interest in the partnership within the 30-year cycle. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project set an example for community-driven projects utilizing public funding in addition to private funding while serving the community with local organization that represent the best interest of the local people.</p>
        
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/Base Map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project is in the northern part of Overtown that falls into Omni CRA district. The project consists of three parcels that borders the Overtown CRA along the north-south axis of Northwest 1st Place connecting to one of the more challenging areas in Omni CRA district. </p>

        <h2>Scale</h2>
        <img src="Project summary/aerial map.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole project consists of five 2-story garden-style apartment buildings covering 29,400 sf in land and 20,312 sf inbuilding. There're in total of 44 units with 12 units studio, 20 units 1 bedroom, 6 units 2 bedrooms and 6 units 3 bedrooms apartments. The renovation started in late 2018 and will be completed in 2025.</p>

        <h2>Significance</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16 corner was the first project that was issued Tax Increment Finance (TIF) by Omni CRA for creating more affordable housing within the Omni CRA district and it was also the first affordable housing project Omni CRA ever funded at that time. </p> 
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project is in historic Overtown, an underserved community, that had experienced displacement in the past and now it is under the pressure of further gentrification and facing a significant housing shortage and homelessness problems. Most of the buildings were built decades earlier and needed renovation and major improvements. The Vagabond Group helped preserving the historical building structures, upgrading the building system along with the interior finishes in each unit to modern standards and sustaining the sense of the community for legacy tenants in Overtown. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, there were no displacement of tenants during the renovation process. The renovation was constructed one building at a time. When one building was under renovation, tenants were moved to vacant units in other buildings within the project. There was no rent increase during the first 5 years and currently, all legacy tenants remain their rent level at or below 60% AMI rent. Moreover, they were offered to move back to their original units after the renovation. The quality of life of tenants were significantly improved after moving into their new units. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, Vagabond has recruited local construction team and contractors creating jobs for local small businesses. Currently, one of the onsite property managers is one of the legacy tenants of 16 corner.</p>
        
        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vagabond Group has conducted community outreach and engagement to ensure the project align with the needs of the residents. </p>  
        <img src="Project summary/kitchen.jpg" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Design with thoughtfulness: Considering tenants’ needs for extra storage, we custom built floor-to-ceiling cabinets creating more space for storage for tenants. We’ve also added walk-in closets with mirror added in each bedroom. Additional features such as deep sink, faucet with extension and full backsplash making it easy for tenants to retain tidiness in kitchen. What’s more, we’ve noticed tenants’ tendency to save electrical bills in the summer, besides traditional AC, we’ve also added ceiling fans in each unit. We deeply care about the wellbeing for tenants. All the windows are altered to larger sizes bringing more natural lights into the units and blinds are installed for all windows. Moreover, larger and heavier doors are installed for each unit providing extra security and protection for tenants. Lastly, the laundry room in the project was long abandoned, we’re going to restore it back to better serve our tenants. </p>
        <img src="Project summary/window.jpg" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built for longevity: Older buildings tend to have weak soundproofing system; we’ve assessed sound attenuation adding resilient channel and extra soundproof in walls. Additionally, considering the humid climate in Miami that easily cause mold growth, we’ve used mold resistant materials to extend the longevity of the building. Lastly, all windows are switched to screened windows allowing extra air circulation if needed.</p>

        <img src="Project summary/sustainability.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sustainability: Track lightings were installed in the kitchen which help reducing energy consumption and improving energy efficiency. We’ve also self-funded additional landscape and exterior features. Notably, we brought three beautiful palm trees to the courtyard between building 1540 and 1550 creating an oasis for tenants.   </p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Safety: Hallways are usually where crimes happen in challenging neighborhood. We’re planning to work with the city to close the hallway between parcel 1 and parcel 3 ensuring safety for our tenants. </p>

        <h2>Challenge </h2>
        <h3>1.Funding challenge</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s commonly known that it is difficult to fund affordable housing development project. 16 Corner has a combination of public funding and private financing methods. Initially, 16 corner received a forgivable loan from Omni CRA of $3.8 million, borrowed $1.76 million loan from a local bank and raised $400k in equity. Additionally, we’ve received $812k from Surtax loan program in 2022 and $585k from DIAF (Development Inflation Adjustment Fund) in 2023</p>
        <img src="Project summary/Project Finanical Summary.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Total projected cost of this project is about $9.2 million averaging $177k per unit. Other than equity, loan program and grants, The Vagabond Group donated developer fee and absorbed architectural project management fee totaling $1 million. See the funding structure graph below for details.</p>
        <img src="Project summary/Funding Structure.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is relatively easier for developers with decades of track records like The Vagabond Group to obtain public funding but for young developers, often it is not an option. How do you make a project financially feasible is a question that many developers struggle with.</p>

        <h3>2.The challenges for dealing with unpredictability in global events. </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking building 1535 as an example. It was the building that was impacted the most in the process. The supply shortage during COVID led to increase in construction material cost. The initial construction estimate was $644k, in the end, the project cost around $1million. </p>
        <img src="Project summary/1535 expense.png" class="project-image">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top 5 construction expenses in this project were Drywall, Electrical, Plumbing, Structure and Windows. Notably, plumbing cost nearly doubled, and window cost increased more than half of its original contract value.</p>

        <h3>3.Financial burden on carry costs and shortfalls.</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being a real estate developer means having extra capital set aside to be able to carry cost moving the project forward. Even 16 corner was seemingly well-funded, it was not enough to cover the shortfalls caused by unforeseeable events. </p>

        <h3>4.The challenge of working with municipalities</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. 16 Corner receive parts of funding from Miami Dade County Surtax loan program. Each time, the draw application generally takes a few months to review and process, the lengthy and time-consuming process often adds extra financial stress and workload on boutique developers. </p>

        <h3>5.The cost of doing things right. </h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1535 was paused for about 2 years during COVID due to strict construction practice and the difficulty faced in moving tenants around for renovation. </p>

        <h3>6.Security and safety challenges</h3>
        <p>During construction, multiple theft incidents happened due to the challenging nature of this neighborhood. For instance, water meters and pole needed in plumbing were stolen twice, and electrical wires were also stolen. Thankfully, Omni CRA provided security service and coordinated with local police office to offer extra security for the project. Imagine if it were come from developers, it would have added extra expenses to this project.</p>
